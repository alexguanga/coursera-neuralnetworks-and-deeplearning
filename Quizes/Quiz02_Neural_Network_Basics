# Week 2 Quiz - Neural Network Basics
******
1. What does a neuron compute?
  - [ ] A neuron computes an activation function followed by a linear function (z = Wx + b)
  - [ ] A neuron computes a function g that scales the input x linearly (Wx + b)
  - [ ] A neuron computes a linear function (z = Wx + b) followed by an activation function
  - [ ] A neuron computes the mean of all features before applying the output to an activation function


2. Which of these is the "Logistic Loss"?
  - [Logistic Loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy#Cross-entropy_error_function_and_logistic_regression)


3. Suppose img is a (32,32,3) array, representing a 32x32 image with 3 color channels red, green and blue. How do you reshape this into a column vector?
  - [x] x = img.reshape((1,32*32,*3))
  - [x] x = img.reshape((3,32*32))
  - [x] x = img.reshape((32*32*3,1))
  - [x] x = img.reshape((32*32,3))


4. Consider the two following random arrays "a" and "b":
```python
a = np.random.randn(2, 3) # a.shape = (2, 3)
b = np.random.randn(2, 1) # b.shape = (2, 1)
c = a + b
```
What will be the shape of "c"?
  - [ ] c.shape = (3, 2)
  - [ ] c.shape = (2, 3)
  - [ ] The computation cannot happen because the sizes don't match. It's going to be "Error"!
  - [ ] c.shape = (2, 1)


5. Consider the two following random arrays "a" and "b":
```python
a = np.random.randn(4, 3) # a.shape = (4, 3)
b = np.random.randn(3, 2) # b.shape = (3, 2)
c = a*b
```
What will be the shape of "c"?
  - [ ] c.shape = (3, 3)
  - [ ] c.shape = (4, 3)
  - [ ] c.shape = (4,2)
  - [ ] The computation cannot happen because the sizes don't match. It's going to be "Error"!


6. Suppose you have n_x input features per example. Recall that X = [x^1 x^2 ... x^m]. What is the dimension of X?
  - [ ] (m,n_x)
  - [ ] (m,1)
  - [ ] (n_x, m)
  - [ ] (1, m)


hat is the dimension of X?

Images for cat recognition is an example of “structured” data, because it is represented as a structured array in a computer. True/False?
- [ ] True
- [x] False


7. A demographic dataset with statistics on different cities' population, GDP per capita, economic growth is an example of “unstructured” data because it contains data coming from different sources. True/False?
- [ ] True
- [x] False


8. Why is an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) used for machine translation, say translating English to French? (Check all that apply.)
- [x] It can be trained as a supervised learning problem.
- [ ] It is strictly more powerful than a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- [x] It is applicable when the input/output is a sequence (e.g., a sequence of words).
- [ ] RNNs represent the recurrent process of Idea->Code->Experiment->Idea->....

9. In this diagram which we hand-drew in lecture, what do the horizontal axis (x-axis) and vertical axis (y-axis) represent?
- x-axis is the amount of data
- y-axis (vertical axis) is the performance of the algorithm.

10. Assuming the trends described in the previous question's figure are accurate (and hoping you got the axis labels right), which of the following are true? (Check all that apply.)
- [x] Increasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
- [x] Increasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
- [ ] Decreasing the size of a neural network generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
- [ ] Decreasing the training set size generally does not hurt an algorithm’s performance, and it may help significantly.
